## OpenAI Sandbox

An environment where I play around with OpenAI's latest tools.

## Setup

1. Create a new file called `.env`.
1. Copy content of `.env.sample`.
1. Paste into the newly created file `.env`.
1. Ensure the values of the environment variables are updated.

## Installation

Run the following:

```
npm install
```

## Scripts

1. To test the general OpenAI use case where you interact with an AI model (similar to ChatGPT), run the following:

```
npm run start:general
```
